# Chathura Galkandage - Projects


### Data & AI Specialist - Data Scientist/ Data Analyst/ Data Consultant/ AI Developer/ AI Researcher
I am a data and AI specialist who has been in the field for nearly 7 years working  in consultancy, industry and academia.
Here I am demonstrating my past projects delivered to external clients, internal teams or as R&D activities.

## AI Projects

### Demand Forecasting with Deep Learning
- Requirement: Client needed a more accurate and scalable forecasting solution to handle various product types, including seasonal and fast-moving items.
- Model: Temporal Fusion ransformer model in PyTorch with multi-horizon on rich features.
- Outcome: Significantly improved client's forecasting accuracy, resulting in a 2.5% increase in product availability. 
  
### Analyst Support with GenAI
-Requirement: Client was looking for SQL on the fly assistance for complex queries
-Model: Gemini Ultra model with data schema trained on it
-Outcome: Productivity on data analyst has increased by 50% in terms of the time consumption on complex queries.

### Document retrieval with Congitive Search
-Requirement: Client wanted to replace the legacy web app for document search using an AI based solution
-Model: Azure Cognitive Search service implemented using Solara for fast-API. 
-Outcome: Document accessibility has increased by 100% in terms of the number of documents per day.

### Customer Review Analysis with NLP
-Requirement: Strategic manager needed to understand the customer feedback in detail to understand business improvement areas.
-Model:A Bert model with sentiment analysis and multi-label, multi-class capability to predict service tags for customer reviews
-Outcome: Produced a dashboard with live customer feedback focus areas in the business using Tableau to support informed decisions 

### Augmented Object Detection using Computer Vision
-Requirement: RFP for a potential client who wants an elegent way to manage the waehouse towards increasing operational efficiency
-Model: Open source SDK for object detection with a simple SQLite database to augment object details.

### Pay by Plate using Computer Vision
-Requirement: In the USA number plates are state specific and highly customized, needing a robut and reliable solution to recognize them inorder to build a payment system on top of that.
-Model: open sorce SDK for OCR while the intepretation build on Transformer models.
-Outcome: MVP recognition system to test the payment platform.

### Sign Interpretation using Deep Learning
-Requirement: Replacing costly humnan interpreter from signed content for broadcasters
-Model: OpenPose based Deep neural network for tranlating spoken laguage to sign poses and vice versa. 
-Outcome: The output of the model is integrated to a media reciever to deliver customizeable content to deaf viewers.

### Fake Image detection using Deep Learning
-Requirement: Detecting and localizing fake content was a high priority for the European commision to control cyber crimes and misleading public.
-Model: Convolutional Neural Network based on VGG16 architecture to detect idenfied forgery types and locate the area of forge
-Outcome: Integrated with text mining, a digital companion on end user browsers were developed to rate the legitimitty over cyber content

## Data Projects

### Data Migration
-Requirement: Mgrating data infrasture in a financial client while mitigating redundancies and preserving the data quality
-Solution: Snowflake warehousing with Alteryx data flow while monitoring the data quality using Alpha system tools.

### Business Management Reporting
-Requirement: Integrating multiple business vertical dashboards to a single dashboard
-Solution: Power BI with semantic models from various sources such as AWS redshift, Grafana dashboards and Share Point. 

### Automated Financial Reporting
-Requirement: Negate the dependency of unreliable 3rd party tools for finance reporting
-Solution: Developed a financial reporting system from the scratch using GCP for data ingestion to a calculation model in Python, with automations on Apache Airflow with HTML templates for reports.

### Convid-predictions using Data Simulations
-Requirement: Interatiely predict the spread of covid-19 based on goverment parametric decisions.
-Solution: Build Python and R based simulation models and Plugging MS SQL server to connect simulation results to a Power BI dashboard

## Academic Projects

### Voice over WLAN PoC using MatLab Simulink
-Requirement: Producing a new communication channel for University students for effective academic communication
-Implementation: MatLab simulink to demonstarte the protocol stack of the productionazeable solution

### Signature Pad with Verification
-Requirement: Verify signatures by training a neural network with personal signatures on a specific signature pad capable of capturing pressure, velocity and noise
-Implementation: Hadware was supported with embedded software to capture data while a simple .NET based UI is implemented to present the model predictions.
