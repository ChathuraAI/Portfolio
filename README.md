## AI Projects

### Demand Forecasting with Deep Learning
- Requirement: Client needed a more accurate and scalable forecasting solution to handle various product types, including seasonal and fast-moving items.
- Model: Temporal Fusion ransformer model in PyTorch with multi-horizon on rich features.
- Outcome: Significantly improved client's forecasting accuracy, resulting in a 2.5% increase in product availability. 
  
### Analyst Support with GenAI
-Requirement: Client was looking for SQL on the fly assistance for complex queries
-Model: Gemini Ultra model with data schema trained on it
-Outcome: Productivity on data analyst has increased by 50% in terms of the time consumption on complex queries.

### Document retrieval with Congitive Search
-Requirement: Client wanted to replace the legacy web app for document search using an AI based solution
-Model: Azure Cognitive Search service implemented using Solara for fast-API. 
-Outcome: Document accessibility has increased by 100% in terms of the number of documents per day.

### Customer Review Analysis with NLP
-Requirement: Strategic manager needed to understand the customer feedback in detail to understand business improvement areas.
